####Node Package Managers

Node Package Managers (NPMs) are a neat part of node.js. NPMs are a set of publicly available, reusable components, available through easy installation via an online repository, with version and dependency management. What this means is that if you need to make a piece of code to perform a certain task, there's most likely somebody else out there who's already made said code and published it to the module ecosystem. All of these modules are accessible via the https://npmjs.org/ website, and can be installed at your leisure.

Some examples of popular modules include...

1. *Express* - a Sinatra-inspired web development framework for Node.js, and the de-facto standard for the majority of Node.js applications out there today.
2. *Socket.io and sockjs* - Server-side component of the two most common websockets components out there today.
