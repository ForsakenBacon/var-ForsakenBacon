#Sublime Vs Visual Studio

Visual Studio is an IDE ( integrated development environment ), aka more than just a text editor. It's a whole environment for writing code, with breakpoints and error codes, and plenty of features. If you like looking at controls more complicated than an airplane, this is for you. 

But, chances are you don't need a really complex program. So a text editor is fine.
