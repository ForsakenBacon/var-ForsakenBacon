Basically I'm just using Sublime for my text editing because it looks the nicest and I'm a sucker for looks. I've installed Eclipse IDE (Integrated Development Environment) but I haven't used it yet because I was busy trying to learn Javascript and ended up slowing down my computer phenomenally making a for loop that never ended! :D
